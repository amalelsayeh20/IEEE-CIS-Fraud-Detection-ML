 IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection

An end-to-end machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using the IEEE-CIS dataset.  

The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.

# Project Description

Fraud detection is a critical challenge in financial systems due to highly imbalanced data and evolving fraud patterns.  

This project applies machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions within the IEEE-CIS dataset, aiming to build an accurate and reliable classification model.



The workflow emphasizes:

\- Handling large-scale, high-dimensional data

\- Managing severe class imbalance

\- Extracting meaningful patterns through feature engineering

\- Evaluating models using appropriate fraud-detection metrics



#  Dataset

The IEEE-CIS dataset consists of transactional and identity-related features representing real-world financial operations.  

It contains a large number of anonymized numerical and categorical variables designed to simulate realistic fraud detection scenarios.
